                <h1>ABOUT</h1>
                <P>Government College of Engineering Kannur has a history of almost thirty
                    years. The college admits 300 students in five branches of study every year
                    and over half of the enrolled are girls and this has remained steady over the
                    years. The majority female students admitted in the past and present have
                    displayed steadfast academic performance and have many a times outnumbered their male counterparts in securing academic laurels such as university
                    ranks. However the unpleasant truth is that a good number of these female
                    academic achievers fail to shine later on in their career and number of alumnae who dwell in the lead roles in jobs are only handful. This dire reality
                    has forced us to put some serious thoughts on the puzzling question <strong>“Why
                    So Few?”</strong >.
                </P>
                <br>
                <p>Thus, ‘Scheme for Her Empowerment in Engineering education (SHE)’ was
                    introduced by the HR cell of GCEK to bridge this existing gap of women in
                    tech. Through techno-socio initiatives, the scheme aims to equip women to
                    face their future confidently in this rapidly changing landscape. The program
                    has been planned in segments and the first phase of the SHE program has
                    focused on training and mentoring of 50 selected female students. These
                    fifty students are perceived to act as “Peer Leaders” who will propagate and
                    partake in providing training to the remaining girls of GCEK.</p>
